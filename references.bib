This paper aims at giving passengers the information about the departure of the subscribed bus from the starting point or the passengers can also subscribe for the number of stops from which he wants the notifications. This is done using a VMD (Variable Message Display) which tracks the coordinates of the bus and sends this information to the Server. By checking the passenger's needs, a notification about the bus with the time is broadcasted to GSM module of all the passengers who have subscribed for similar type of service. For subscribing for a bus and to get the notification, a Mobile Application based on Android OS is developed. The application is tried on less number of buses first and later it will be tested on huge transportation system.},

	abstract = {As population is burgeoning, there is an increase in the number of vehicles on the road and hence an upsurge in the problems associated with traffic management, especially the Public Transport. There is also an increase in the number of accidents and various other traffic related issues. Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) provides the solution to most of these problems by integrating existing technologies with the underlying infrastructure. With the advent of mobile technology and the ubiquitous cellular network, real time vehicle tracking for efficient transport management has become viable. The futile long wait for a bus to arrive can be avoided by Intelligent Public Transportation System. The omnipresence of Smart Phones and their ever increasing power at a very economical price makes them one of the most attractive options for developing IOT applications. Here, an approach based on the combination of technologies like GPS and Android is discussed which can assuage passengers who commute by the means of public transport. The user is furnished with explicit information about the current location of nearest buses approaching the bus-stop on a mobile application. Using readily available Android API's, technologies like 3G network and SMS based services in the existing mobile phones can reduce the cost and size of hardware required, as well as lead to a better output.},

Impact of certain activities, poor land use, and limited infrastructure development physically leads to the increase of travel necessities which then causes traffic congestion almost during the whole day. One of the aspects needed to create a sustainable metropolitan city is good public transportation. The case study is carried out in Bandung. Based on existing conditions found in Bandung's public transportation, with paratransit as common public transportation and a limited number of mass rapid transit, therefore proposed alternative solutions could be as follow: the availability of city regulation, effort to reduce traffic congestion, orderly operation of paratransit, fixed route of medium and large bus operation, adherence of road users to traffic regulation, and good land use management, that involve all stakeholders.},

People who rely on the public transport their major concern is to know the real time location of the bus for which they are waiting for and the time it will take to reach their bus stop. This information helps people in making better travelling decisions. This paper gives the major challenges in the public transport system and discuses various approaches to intelligently manage it. Current position of the bus is acquired by integrating GPS device on the bus and coordinates of the bus are sent by either GPRS service provided by GSM networks or SMS or RFID. GPS device is enabled on the tracking device and this information is sent to centralized control unit or directly at the bus stops using RF receivers. This system is further integrated with the historical average speeds of each segment. This is done to improve the accuracy by including the factors like volume of traffic, crossings in each segment, day and time of day. People can track information using LEDs at bus stops, SMS, web application or Android application. GPS coordinates of the bus when sent to the centralized server where various arrival time estimation algorithms are applied using historical speed patterns.},

	abstract = {The number of traffic accidents in Indonesia is still relatively high. According to the official data, there were 107,500 cases of accidents in 2019. The accident was caused by various factors, including human factors as much as 61%. This indicates the driver's lack of awareness to comply with traffic regulations such as the maximum speed limit for vehicles. Based on these conditions, it is necessary to make a device that can observe the speed of the vehicle, so that the driver does not exceed the maximum speed limit of the vehicle on the highway. This paper describes on a prototype of the vehicle speed recorder using GPS tracker and Internet-of-Things (IoT) platform. GPS tracker determines the location of a vehicle any time. The speed of a vehicle is computed by using Arduino microcontroller and SIM808 module. Furthermore, the location and speed of a vehicle is sent to a dedicated webserver such that the IoT platform so called Adafruit IO could proceed and display how much the speed of a vehicle being traveled and its location in the real time. Experimental results show that the prototype of vehicle speed recorder can display a location with high accuracy and can render an average speed discrepancy of 3.9 kph during travelling at a certain route. The discrepancy between the value of speed and the location of a vehicle occurs due to the delay in sending latitude and longitude coordinate data from the SIM808 module to the IoT platform.},

	abstract = {<p>As in this era enormous development of electronic technology specifically the application area of micro-controllers have resulted in a lot of innovative and inexpensive control applications. All the activities in household or industry are directly or indirectly associated with information technology and now controllers are found in almost all the automation based application. The aim of this hardware based project work is to technically understand relay control mechanism which is pertinent to the analysis and design of automated control systems. Electromagnetic relays provide a well-established solution to switching loads in a different applications. This paper presents the designs and the simulation of a relay control system based on three different techniques. Firstly we have designed relay control using adjustable LM317 voltage regulators. Secondly we have introduced the method of closed loop control with a temperature sensor (LM35) and an actuator (relay) and applied this method to building a controller with fixed voltage regulated supply that will maintain a desired temperature. Finally to develop an Arduino based room temperature sensor application. The temperature sensor IC LM35 senses the temperature and its corresponding electrical signal is forwarded to the microcontroller. The 16x2-line LCD is used to display the temperature sensed by LM35 and set values of the temperature, and accordingly the relay gets turned OFF. Also the PCB layout is designed for each setup using Express PCB software. It is being concluded that all the three designed model has accurate working capabilities in comparison to Programmable Logic Control (PLC's) circuits and is better and cost effective substitute for them. The designed project can be used for industrial applications or as a training module in teaching courses of industrial automation or mechatronics. This project uses regulated 12V, 2A power supply.</p>},

	abstract = {Abstrak        Pada penelitian ini, untuk optimalisasi penyediaan energi listrik di Indonesia, diperlukan suatu perkiraan / peramalan kebutuhan energi listrik. Metoda peramalan yang digunakan adalah logika fuzzy dan jaringan saraf tiruan backpropagation dengan dua lapisan tersembunyi dan satu lapisan output. Peramalan yang dilakukan bersifat jangka panjang, yaitu sampai tahun 2022. Peramalan / perkiraan kebutuhan energi listrik jangka panjang umumnya mengacu pada statistik masa lalu dan atas dasar analisis karakteristik konsumsi energi yang lalu.  Karakteristik tersebut biasanya dipengaruhi oleh beberapa faktor, seperti jumlah penduduk, jumlah pelanggan listrik (rumah tangga, industri, bisnis, sosial, gedung kantor pemerintah, penerangan jalan umum), rasio elektrifikasi, pertumbuhan ekonomi dan lain sebagainya. Sehingga, metoda logika fuzzy ini menggunakan data historis / aktual yang diakumulasikan dalam beberapa periode waktu, yaitu dari tahun 2004 sampai 2012. Hasil peramalan dengan menggunakan logika fuzzy dan menunjukkan bahwa kebutuhan energi listrik di Indonesia pada tahun 2022 sebesar 215.203 GWh. Nilai ini tidak jauh berbeda dengan peramalan yang dilakukan oleh jaringan saraf tiruan backpropagation yaitu sebesar 242.120  GWh. Nilai kesalahan (error) antara hasil peramalan logika fuzzy dengan jaringan saraf tiruan backpropagation pada tahun 2022 masing- masing adalah 8,2413% dan 2,8027%.          Kata kunci   : logika fuzzy  , jaringan saraf tiruan back propagation,   peramalan kebutuhan energi listrik,   , data historis / aktual  ,             Abstract          In this research to optimize the energy supply of electricity in Indonesia required an estimation / forecasting of electric energy needs., forecasting methods used are fuzzy logic and Backpropagation neural network with two hidden layers and one output layer. Forecasting is done long term, until 2022. Forecast / estimate the long-term electric energy demand generally refers to the statistics of the past and on the basis of analysis of energy consumption characteristics ago. Such characteristics are usually influenced by several factors, such as population, number of electricity customers (home, industry, business, social, goverment office, public lighting), electrification ratio, economic growth and the others. Thus, this fuzzy logic method and Backpropagation neural network uses historical data / actual accumulated in several time periods, namely from 2004 to 2012. The results of forecasting using fuzzy logic and Backpropagation neural network shows that the electrical energy needs in Indonesia in 2022 amounted to 215.203 GWh. This value is not much different from the prediction made by Backpropagation neural network, which amounted to 242. 120  GWh. Error value between the results of forecasting with fuzzy logic to Backpropagation neural network in 2022 was 8,2413% and 2,8027% .       Key words  : fuzzy logic,   backpropagation   neural network ,electric energy demand forecasting, historical data /  actual,},

Due to the increasing scholarly attention, the literature landscape has become scattered and fragmented. With a focus on the commercial application of the IoT and corresponding research, we employ a co-citation analysis and literature review to structure the field. We find and describe 19 research themes. To consolidate the extant research, we propose a research framework, which is based on a theoretical implementation process of IoT as a concept, specific IoT applications, or architectures integrated in an adapted input–process–output model. The main variables of the model are an initial definition and conceptualization of an IoT concept (input), which goes through an evaluation process (process), before it is implemented and can have an impact in practice (output). The paper contributes to interdisciplinary research relating to a business and management perspective on IoT by providing a holistic overview of predominant research themes and an integrative research framework.</p>},

	abstract = {Wallet is an important item for individuals to carry personal valuable items such as Identification Card, money, bank cards and many more. Unfortunately, people do not consider a wallet as an important item to be protected from damage, theft or even misplaced by its owner. People tend to carelessly misplace their wallets or even lost their wallets. Therefore, this study focuses on the development of a mobile application for wallet tracking. The mobile app was developed for the Android Operating System with Google Maps API and Google Positioning System (GPS) tracker. The Firebase Real-time database is functioning as a cloud database that provides real-time responses. The prototype has been evaluated with real users using the functionality and usability test. The results from the testing show that the application has the potential to be used as a wallet tracker and assist people to track the lost wallet.},

	abstract = {In today's modern world, automobiles have become an integral element of everyone's life. In contemporary modernized urban life, situations and circumstances have a significant impact in automobile utilization. When considering both sides of the coin, this has its own set of consequences, one of which being air pollution. Every vehicle produces emissions; however, the primary issue arises when the emissions exceed the defined limits set by India's pollution control board. The main cause of this infraction of emission standards is caused by inadequate vehicle maintenance and culminates in inadequate combustion of fuels supplied to the engine. Although vehicle emissions cannot be totally prevented, they can be significantly reduced. Using the advancement of semiconducting sensors used to monitor a myriad of gases, this project seeks to use those semiconductor sensors at vehicle emission outlets to detect the level of pollutants and display that level with a meter. When the pollution or emission level exceeds the previously specified threshold level, the car will emit a buzz to indicate that the limit has been exceeded, and the vehicle will come to a halt after a predetermined period of time, allowing the driver to park his or her vehicle. When the timer runs out, the gasoline supply to the engine is shut off, a fee is incurred, and the vehicle must be towed to a repairman or a service facility center nearby. A Raspberry Pi monitors and controls the entire process's synchronization and execution. When this project is enhanced as a tangible endeavor project, it will perk society and aid in the reduction of air pollution.},
