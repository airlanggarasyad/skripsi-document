	abstract = {As population is burgeoning, there is an increase in the number of vehicles on the road and hence an upsurge in the problems associated with traffic management, especially the Public Transport. There is also an increase in the number of accidents and various other traffic related issues. Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) provides the solution to most of these problems by integrating existing technologies with the underlying infrastructure. With the advent of mobile technology and the ubiquitous cellular network, real time vehicle tracking for efficient transport management has become viable. The futile long wait for a bus to arrive can be avoided by Intelligent Public Transportation System. The omnipresence of Smart Phones and their ever increasing power at a very economical price makes them one of the most attractive options for developing IOT applications. Here, an approach based on the combination of technologies like GPS and Android is discussed which can assuage passengers who commute by the means of public transport. The user is furnished with explicit information about the current location of nearest buses approaching the bus-stop on a mobile application. Using readily available Android API's, technologies like 3G network and SMS based services in the existing mobile phones can reduce the cost and size of hardware required, as well as lead to a better output.},

This paper aims at giving passengers the information about the departure of the subscribed bus from the starting point or the passengers can also subscribe for the number of stops from which he wants the notifications. This is done using a VMD (Variable Message Display) which tracks the coordinates of the bus and sends this information to the Server. By checking the passenger's needs, a notification about the bus with the time is broadcasted to GSM module of all the passengers who have subscribed for similar type of service. For subscribing for a bus and to get the notification, a Mobile Application based on Android OS is developed. The application is tried on less number of buses first and later it will be tested on huge transportation system.},

Impact of certain activities, poor land use, and limited infrastructure development physically leads to the increase of travel necessities which then causes traffic congestion almost during the whole day. One of the aspects needed to create a sustainable metropolitan city is good public transportation. The case study is carried out in Bandung. Based on existing conditions found in Bandung's public transportation, with paratransit as common public transportation and a limited number of mass rapid transit, therefore proposed alternative solutions could be as follow: the availability of city regulation, effort to reduce traffic congestion, orderly operation of paratransit, fixed route of medium and large bus operation, adherence of road users to traffic regulation, and good land use management, that involve all stakeholders.},

	abstract = {In this fast life, everyone is in hurry to reach their destinations. In this case waiting for the buses is not reliable. People who rely on the public transport their major concern is to know the real time location of the bus for which they are waiting for and the time it will take to reach their bus stop. This information helps people in making better travelling decisions. This paper gives the major challenges in the public transport system and discuses various approaches to intelligently manage it. Current position of the bus is acquired by integrating GPS device on the bus and coordinates of the bus are sent by either GPRS service provided by GSM networks or SMS or RFID. GPS device is enabled on the tracking device and this information is sent to centralized control unit or directly at the bus stops using RF receivers. This system is further integrated with the historical average speeds of each segment. This is done to improve the accuracy by including the factors like volume of traffic, crossings in each segment, day and time of day. People can track information using LEDs at bus stops, SMS, web application or Android application. GPS coordinates of the bus when sent to the centralized server where various arrival time estimation algorithms are applied using historical speed patterns.},

	abstract = {In today's modern world, automobiles have become an integral element of everyone's life. In contemporary modernized urban life, situations and circumstances have a significant impact in automobile utilization. When considering both sides of the coin, this has its own set of consequences, one of which being air pollution. Every vehicle produces emissions; however, the primary issue arises when the emissions exceed the defined limits set by India's pollution control board. The main cause of this infraction of emission standards is caused by inadequate vehicle maintenance and culminates in inadequate combustion of fuels supplied to the engine. Although vehicle emissions cannot be totally prevented, they can be significantly reduced. Using the advancement of semiconducting sensors used to monitor a myriad of gases, this project seeks to use those semiconductor sensors at vehicle emission outlets to detect the level of pollutants and display that level with a meter. When the pollution or emission level exceeds the previously specified threshold level, the car will emit a buzz to indicate that the limit has been exceeded, and the vehicle will come to a halt after a predetermined period of time, allowing the driver to park his or her vehicle. When the timer runs out, the gasoline supply to the engine is shut off, a fee is incurred, and the vehicle must be towed to a repairman or a service facility center nearby. A Raspberry Pi monitors and controls the entire process's synchronization and execution. When this project is enhanced as a tangible endeavor project, it will perk society and aid in the reduction of air pollution.},

	abstract = {The number of traffic accidents in Indonesia is still relatively high. According to the official data, there were 107,500 cases of accidents in 2019. The accident was caused by various factors, including human factors as much as 61%. This indicates the driver's lack of awareness to comply with traffic regulations such as the maximum speed limit for vehicles. Based on these conditions, it is necessary to make a device that can observe the speed of the vehicle, so that the driver does not exceed the maximum speed limit of the vehicle on the highway. This paper describes on a prototype of the vehicle speed recorder using GPS tracker and Internet-of-Things (IoT) platform. GPS tracker determines the location of a vehicle any time. The speed of a vehicle is computed by using Arduino microcontroller and SIM808 module. Furthermore, the location and speed of a vehicle is sent to a dedicated webserver such that the IoT platform so called Adafruit IO could proceed and display how much the speed of a vehicle being traveled and its location in the real time. Experimental results show that the prototype of vehicle speed recorder can display a location with high accuracy and can render an average speed discrepancy of 3.9 kph during travelling at a certain route. The discrepancy between the value of speed and the location of a vehicle occurs due to the delay in sending latitude and longitude coordinate data from the SIM808 module to the IoT platform.},
