	abstract = {As population is burgeoning, there is an increase in the number of vehicles on the road and hence an upsurge in the problems associated with traffic management, especially the Public Transport. There is also an increase in the number of accidents and various other traffic related issues. Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) provides the solution to most of these problems by integrating existing technologies with the underlying infrastructure. With the advent of mobile technology and the ubiquitous cellular network, real time vehicle tracking for efficient transport management has become viable. The futile long wait for a bus to arrive can be avoided by Intelligent Public Transportation System. The omnipresence of Smart Phones and their ever increasing power at a very economical price makes them one of the most attractive options for developing IOT applications. Here, an approach based on the combination of technologies like GPS and Android is discussed which can assuage passengers who commute by the means of public transport. The user is furnished with explicit information about the current location of nearest buses approaching the bus-stop on a mobile application. Using readily available Android API's, technologies like 3G network and SMS based services in the existing mobile phones can reduce the cost and size of hardware required, as well as lead to a better output.},

Impact of certain activities, poor land use, and limited infrastructure development physically leads to the increase of travel necessities which then causes traffic congestion almost during the whole day. One of the aspects needed to create a sustainable metropolitan city is good public transportation. The case study is carried out in Bandung. Based on existing conditions found in Bandung's public transportation, with paratransit as common public transportation and a limited number of mass rapid transit, therefore proposed alternative solutions could be as follow: the availability of city regulation, effort to reduce traffic congestion, orderly operation of paratransit, fixed route of medium and large bus operation, adherence of road users to traffic regulation, and good land use management, that involve all stakeholders.},

People who rely on the public transport their major concern is to know the real time location of the bus for which they are waiting for and the time it will take to reach their bus stop. This information helps people in making better travelling decisions. This paper gives the major challenges in the public transport system and discuses various approaches to intelligently manage it. Current position of the bus is acquired by integrating GPS device on the bus and coordinates of the bus are sent by either GPRS service provided by GSM networks or SMS or RFID. GPS device is enabled on the tracking device and this information is sent to centralized control unit or directly at the bus stops using RF receivers. This system is further integrated with the historical average speeds of each segment. This is done to improve the accuracy by including the factors like volume of traffic, crossings in each segment, day and time of day. People can track information using LEDs at bus stops, SMS, web application or Android application. GPS coordinates of the bus when sent to the centralized server where various arrival time estimation algorithms are applied using historical speed patterns.},

	abstract = {The number of traffic accidents in Indonesia is still relatively high. According to the official data, there were 107,500 cases of accidents in 2019. The accident was caused by various factors, including human factors as much as 61%. This indicates the driver's lack of awareness to comply with traffic regulations such as the maximum speed limit for vehicles. Based on these conditions, it is necessary to make a device that can observe the speed of the vehicle, so that the driver does not exceed the maximum speed limit of the vehicle on the highway. This paper describes on a prototype of the vehicle speed recorder using GPS tracker and Internet-of-Things (IoT) platform. GPS tracker determines the location of a vehicle any time. The speed of a vehicle is computed by using Arduino microcontroller and SIM808 module. Furthermore, the location and speed of a vehicle is sent to a dedicated webserver such that the IoT platform so called Adafruit IO could proceed and display how much the speed of a vehicle being traveled and its location in the real time. Experimental results show that the prototype of vehicle speed recorder can display a location with high accuracy and can render an average speed discrepancy of 3.9 kph during travelling at a certain route. The discrepancy between the value of speed and the location of a vehicle occurs due to the delay in sending latitude and longitude coordinate data from the SIM808 module to the IoT platform.},

	abstract = {In today's modern world, automobiles have become an integral element of everyone's life. In contemporary modernized urban life, situations and circumstances have a significant impact in automobile utilization. When considering both sides of the coin, this has its own set of consequences, one of which being air pollution. Every vehicle produces emissions; however, the primary issue arises when the emissions exceed the defined limits set by India's pollution control board. The main cause of this infraction of emission standards is caused by inadequate vehicle maintenance and culminates in inadequate combustion of fuels supplied to the engine. Although vehicle emissions cannot be totally prevented, they can be significantly reduced. Using the advancement of semiconducting sensors used to monitor a myriad of gases, this project seeks to use those semiconductor sensors at vehicle emission outlets to detect the level of pollutants and display that level with a meter. When the pollution or emission level exceeds the previously specified threshold level, the car will emit a buzz to indicate that the limit has been exceeded, and the vehicle will come to a halt after a predetermined period of time, allowing the driver to park his or her vehicle. When the timer runs out, the gasoline supply to the engine is shut off, a fee is incurred, and the vehicle must be towed to a repairman or a service facility center nearby. A Raspberry Pi monitors and controls the entire process's synchronization and execution. When this project is enhanced as a tangible endeavor project, it will perk society and aid in the reduction of air pollution.},

	abstract = {<p>LoRa is a long-range, low power, low bit rate and single-hop wireless communication technology. It is intended to be used in Internet of Things (IoT) applications involving battery-powered devices with low throughput requirements. A LoRaWAN network consists of multiple end nodes that communicate with one or more gateways. These gateways act like a transparent bridge towards a common network server. The amount of end devices and their throughput requirements will have an impact on the performance of the LoRaWAN network. This study investigates the scalability in terms of the number of end devices per gateway of single-gateway LoRaWAN deployments. First, we determine the intra-technology interference behavior with two physical end nodes, by checking the impact of an interfering node on a transmitting node. Measurements show that even under concurrent transmission, one of the packets can be received under certain conditions. Based on these measurements, we create a simulation model for assessing the scalability of a single gateway LoRaWAN network. We show that when the number of nodes increases up to 1000 per gateway, the losses will be up to 32%. In such a case, pure Aloha will have around 90% losses. However, when the duty cycle of the application layer becomes lower than the allowed radio duty cycle of 1%, losses will be even lower. We also show network scalability simulation results for some IoT use cases based on real data.</p>},

Improved supervision of children is needed without reducing the freedom of children to learn and explore their environment. One alternative that allows tracking the presence, location, and accuracy is quite good is to use a Geo Positioning System (GPS). This GPS is packaged in a flexible form so that it can help make it easier for parents to supervise their children in the range of areas that are still accessible to them and find the child's position when separated from their parents. The system can send the location information of children who are lost or lost on smartphone applications used by parents. </p>},

@article{Li2019,
	abstract = {<p>Global navigation satellite system (GNSS) orbits are traditionally determined by observation data of ground stations, which usually need even global distribution to ensure adequate observation geometry strength. However, good tracking geometry cannot be achieved for all GNSS satellites due to many factors, such as limited ground stations and special stationary characteristics for the geostationary Earth orbit (GEO) satellites in the BeiDou constellation. Fortunately, the onboard observations from low earth orbiters (LEO) can be an important supplement to overcome the weakness in tracking geometry. In this contribution, we perform large LEO constellation-augmented multi-GNSS precise orbit determination (POD) based on simulated GNSS observations. Six LEO constellations with different satellites numbers, orbit types, and altitudes, as well as global and regional ground networks, are designed to assess the influence of different tracking configurations on the integrated POD. Then, onboard and ground-based GNSS observations are simulated, without regard to the observations between LEO satellites and ground stations. The results show that compared with ground-based POD, a remarkable accuracy improvement of over 70% can be observed for all GNSS satellites when the entire LEO constellation is introduced. Particularly, BDS GEO satellites can obtain centimeter-level orbits, with the largest accuracy improvement being 98%. Compared with the 60-LEO and 66-LEO schemes, the 96-LEO scheme yields an improvement in orbit accuracy of about 1 cm for GEO satellites and 1 mm for other satellites because of the increase of LEO satellites, but leading to a steep rise in the computational time. In terms of the orbital types, the sun-synchronous-orbiting constellation can yield a better tracking geometry for GNSS satellites and a stronger augmentation than the polar-orbiting constellation. As for the LEO altitude, there are almost no large-orbit accuracy differences among the 600, 1000, and 1400 km schemes except for BDS GEO satellites. Furthermore, the GNSS orbit is found to have less dependence on ground stations when incorporating a large number of LEO. The orbit accuracy of the integrated POD with 8 global stations is almost comparable to the result of integrated POD with a denser global network of 65 stations. In addition, we also present an analysis concerning the integrated POD with a partial LEO constellation. The result demonstrates that introducing part of a LEO constellation can be an effective way to balance the conflict between the orbit accuracy and computational efficiency.</p>},
